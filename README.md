# Minimal C++ GTK4 application using cppgir bindings

This project is a minimal GTK4 C++ application that uses C++ bindings generated by [cppgir](https://gitlab.com/mnauw/cppgir). It also demonstrates how to use a modern GTK UI description language, [Blueprint](https://jwestman.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/blueprint-compiler).

C++ bindings are auto-generated as a first step of the build process. The generation method used in the Meson build files is essential to this demo because the process is very convoluted due to https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/issues/2320.
